# Sudoku-Solver
This repository contains two main files. One file is the original sudoku solver that I wrote, which is capable of solving any sudoku board using the backtracking algorithm. The second file was added in to create a Graphical User Interface where a user can play sudoku.

To play sudoku, just run SudokuGUI.py

# Instructions to play
Launch the Sudoku game by running the SudokuGUI.py Python script.
The game window will open, displaying the Sudoku grid.
Use the mouse cursor to navigate and interact with the game.
Buttons and their purposes:

Number Keys (1-9): Press any number key to select the corresponding digit as the input value.
Delete Key: Press the Delete key to clear the selected cell's value.
Spacebar: Press the Spacebar to automatically solve the Sudoku puzzle.
Return/Enter Key: Press the Return/Enter key to enter the selected digit into the Sudoku grid.
Gameplay:

Select a cell by clicking on it. The selected cell will be highlighted in red.
Choose a number (1-9) to input into the selected cell. The selected digit will be displayed in the cell.
If you want to change or clear a value, either select the cell again and enter a different number or press the Delete key to clear the cell.
To check if the number entered in the cell is correct, press the Return/Enter key. If the number is correct, it will be displayed in black. Otherwise, it will be displayed in red.
Continue filling in the cells with the correct numbers based on the Sudoku rules.
If you get stuck or want to see the solution, press the Spacebar to automatically solve the Sudoku puzzle.
The game will end when all cells are filled correctly and the entire Sudoku grid is solved.
Remember to pay attention to the strikes (X) displayed at the bottom. Strikes are counted when an incorrect number is entered in a cell.

Enjoy playing Sudoku and have fun!
